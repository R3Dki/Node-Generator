# Node-Generator
A Particle Network made for my portfolio, i made it inspired by particles.js' particle network mode. It doesn't run as smooth but i made its setup as simple as possible.
# Features
It might not support hundreds of particles but it's very customizable and easy to use, you can, for example, modify colors, nodes' properites and a bit more.
# Setup
The basic setup of this script is very quick and easy, you can see an example of it in my portfolio.
When you've completed the site setup i reccomend you to read the comments on the first part of "Node Generator.js" to learn how to configure it.
You may need to tweak things a bit to have it look nice, but this process will take less than 2 minutes probably.
# 
You just need to create a canvas element in your HTML page and give it an id(e.g. canvas) and then make a script with an src="wherever/you/put/it/Node Generator.js" argument and the job is done.
Inside the css i reccomend you create a style for it (with #whateveryounamedit) and modify its position as absolute(position: absolute;).
