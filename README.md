# Node-Generator
A Particle Network made for my portfolio, i made it inspired by particles.js' particle network mode. It doesn't run as smooth but i made its setup as simple as possible.

The basic setup of this script is very quick and simple, you just have to create a canvas element (<canvas id="[whatever u want]" class="nodegen"></canvas>)
